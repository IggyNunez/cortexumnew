SECTION 1: HERO
Headline:
 Your marketing isn’t broken.
Your landing page is.
Subheadline:
 Before spending more on ads, content, or traffic — we’ll show you where conversion is leaking and what to fix first.
Primary CTA Button:
 👉 Request a Landing Page Review
Supporting Microcopy (under CTA):
 No sales pitch. If we see a clear opportunity, we’ll show you.
________________


Headline:
 We’ll show you what you’ve been missing.
Body Copy:
 Traffic doesn’t disappear.
Attention doesn’t vanish.
It leaks — quietly — at specific points most founders never see.
We’ll surface those points and show you how your page should guide decisions instead of forcing them.

SECTION 3: WHAT YOU’LL RECEIVE
Section Title:
 What happens after you submit
Step 1:
 We review your page + responses
 We’re not looking for flaws — we’re looking for friction.
Step 2:
 We draft an optimized page direction
 This may include a revised hero, CTA flow, page structure, and messaging hierarchy.
Step 3 (Conditional):
 If it makes sense to implement together, we’ll outline next steps.
If not, you’ll still have clarity you can act on.

SECTION 4: WHAT’S INCLUDED (IMPORTANT ADDITION)
Section Title:
[a] What we evaluate (beyond surface-level design)
Bullet Points:
* Message-to-market alignment

* Conversion flow and cognitive friction

* Offer clarity and CTA sequencing

* Trust signals and objection handling

* AI SEO + traditional SEO structure
 (ensuring the page is optimized for both human decision-making and modern search behavior)

Supporting Line:
 High-converting pages today need to speak clearly to people and be structured for how search engines now interpret intent.
Developer Note:
 Do not over-explain AI here.
This should read as “of course they do this”, not a feature pitch.

SECTION 5: WHO THIS IS FOR / NOT FOR
Section Title:
 Is this a fit?
This is for founders who:
   * Are already driving traffic

   * Believe in their offer

   * Feel conversions lag behind attention

   * Want clarity, not gimmicks

This is not for:
      * Early-stage idea validation

      * Businesses without existing traffic

      * Anyone looking for “free work” with no intent
